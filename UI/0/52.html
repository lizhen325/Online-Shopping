                    <td colspan="2"><p>Don't buy this book until you understand what you're getting into. As you can tell from the 5-star reviews, beginning coders love this book. And as you can tell from the 1-star reviews, some experienced programmers don't. What beginners like-that the book assumes no programming knowledge and is written in plain English-can make the book feel simple-minded to an expert. So if you're an experienced programmer, please don't rush into a purchase that's wrong for you and then give my book a 1-star review. If you're curious about my approach, download a free sample. Try the free online exercises. You'll soon know whether or not you want to spend 40 hours learning JavaScript in my "classroom." You may like it, though. Plenty of veterans have told me, "I wish someone had used this approach to teach me HTML, PHP, jQuery, C#, Ruby, Java, Python-fill in the blank]." But don't assume. Try before you buy. (Not a bad idea if you're a beginner, either. Why take a chance on a book if you don't have to?) If you commit to my approach, you'll find that the book is just the tip of the iceberg. The larger part is the abundance of interactive exercises that encourage you to practice, practice, practice. You'll agree, I think, that without practice, a coding student might as well be reading a novel. Here's what's different about my book: Testing showed that books and courses load up the reader with far too much information at a time. So I divide up the information into little chunks that won't overwhelm anyone. A book on coding doesn't have to be written in impenetrable legalese. It can actually be human-readable. My book is. Most people learn best through examples, so I provide plenty of them. Most important, before you have a chance to forget what you've read in the book, I ask you to fire up your desktop or laptop (not your mobile device) and head over to my website, where you run a set of interactive exercises, practicing everything you've learned-until you're sure you've mastered it. Readers tell me they often start the exercises thinking they know the material cold. and quickly find out they don't. The automated exercise manager keeps you at it until your overconfidence becomes real confidence-confidence that's based on your excellent performance. There are 1,750 exercises in all. They're all interactive, with an automated answer-checker that corrects your missteps and points you in the right direction when you stumble. And they're all free. Readers tell me the combination of book and interactive exercises is involving, fun, frustration-free, addictive, confidence-building, and...well, read the reviews.</p></td>
