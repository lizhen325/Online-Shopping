        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
           Hi, My name is Zhen Li. I'm  from China. I just graduated  from Massey University with a degree in Computer and Electronic Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last semester before graduation, I felt very confused to what can i do after graduation. Luckly, I have good friends, they are good at programming. Therefore, I just started programming and learned from them. Although the begnning is always the most difficult, I belive that hold fast to your dreams go as long as you can.You will succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            So now I am currently doing an internship in web developer with a company named Xorro-Q. Since it is a small company I feel that I can learn more and get the skills necessary to find a good job. I really enjoy coding and would love to get more in depth into programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would love to improve my programming skills and to become a professional programmer.
        </p>
